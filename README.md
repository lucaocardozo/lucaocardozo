### Hi there 👋

My name is Lucas Martins Cardozo from Brazil (🇧🇷). I study Computer Engineering at [UTFPR - Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná](http://portal.utfpr.edu.br/). I'm passionate about software development and I've always loved to produce a lot of content.

In my free time I like to play games (🎮) to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), to listen to music (🎵) and eventually I like to drink a beer (🍺).

Would you like to find me?
